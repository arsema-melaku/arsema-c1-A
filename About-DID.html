        Dissociative identity disorder (previously known as multiple personality disorder) 
        is thought to be a complex psychological condition that is likely caused by many factors, 
        including severe trauma during early childhood 
        (usually extreme, repetitive physical, sexual, or emotional abuse).
        It is a severe form of dissociation, a mental process which produces a lack of connection 
        in a person's thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of identity. Dissociative identity 
        disorder is thought to stem from a combination of factors that may include trauma experienced by 
        the person with the disorder. The dissociative aspect is thought to be a coping mechanism -- the 
        person literally shuts off or dissociates themselves from a situation or experience 
        that's too violent, traumatic, or painful to assimilate with their conscious self.
        Research indicates that the cause of DID is likely a psychological response to interpersonal 
        and environmental stresses, particularly during early childhood years when emotional neglect 
        or abuse may interfere with personality development. As many as 99% of individuals who develop 
        dissociative disorders have recognized personal histories of recurring, overpowering, and often
        life-threatening disturbances or traumas at a sensitive developmental stage of childhood 
        (usually before age 6).
        Dissociation may also happen when there has been persistent neglect or emotional abuse, even 
        when there has been no overt physical or sexual abuse. Findings show that in families where 
        parents are frightening and unpredictable, the children may become dissociative. 
        Studies indicate DID affects about 1% of the population.
        The process of dissociation usually occurs outside your own awareness 
        though you may also realize it is happening, particularly if it is in 
        the context of anxiety. The experience involves a disconnection between 
        your memory, consciousness, identity, and thoughts. In other words, while 
        normally your brain processes events (such as your memories, identity, 
        perceptions, motor function, etc.) together, during dissociation, these 
        parts splinter, leaving you with a feeling of disconnection. 
        Dissociation is a general term that refers to a detachment from 
        many things.
        <h2>Depersonalization</h2>
        With depersonalization, your mind feels disconnected from your 
        thoughts, feelings, actions, or body. Examples of this include 
        feeling like you are watching a movie about yourself or that you 
        don't have an identity. Some of the symptoms experienced as a 
        result of depersonalization include the following: Alterations in your perceptions, 
        Distorted sense of time, 
        Emotional or physical numbing, Feelings of yourself being unreal 
        or absent
        <h2>Derealization</h2>
        Derealization causes a sensation where the world does not feel real. 
        Examples of this include seeing the world all in shades of grey or 
        having tunnel vision when looking at the world. The symptoms involved
         with derealization include: Feeing the world as flat, dull, or grey, 
         Feeling like the world around you is not real, Having tunnel vision when you look at the world
