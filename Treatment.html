        <h2>Medication</h2>
        At the moment, there are no medications for dissociative disorders 
        themselves, although you may take medication for some symptoms. 
        Some research has gone into the use of fluoxetine to treat 
        depersonalisation/derealisation disorder (DPDR). 
        But at the moment the results are not clear and more research 
        is needed. In dissociative identity disorder (DID) different 
        identities may respond differently to medication.If you have 
        episodes of dissociation you might also have a condition such 
        as depression or anxiety. Some medications could help with this. 
        For example antidepressants could be used for depressive symptoms 
        and benzodiazepines for anxiety.
        <h2>Psychosocial treatments</h2>
        Talking therapies are usually recommended for dissociation. 
        There are lots of different types of talking therapy. 
        Different ones might be used for different dissociative 
        disorders.
        <h3>Psychodynamic psychotherapy</h3>
        If you have DID then your doctors may think about long-term 
        psychodynamic psychotherapy. This is a type of therapy where 
        you talk about your relationships and thoughts. You might talk 
        about your past. Your therapist can link the ways you think and 
        act with things that have happened to you. For DID, psychotherapy 
        might be needed for a long time, with at least 1 session every week. 
        This might be increased if your DID is quite complex, or if it 
        causes you lots of problems.
        <h3>Eye movement desensitisation reprocessing (EMDR)</h3>
        DID may also be helped by eye-movement desensitization 
        and reprocessing (EMDR). In EMDR you make side-to-side 
        eye movements while talking about the trauma that happened. 
        Nobody fully understands how EMDR works, but it could help you 
        to deal past trauma and flashbacks. Doctors must be careful when 
        using EMDR because it could make your DID worse if not done 
        properly. But EMDR can have benefits when it is used along with 
        other treatment. The type of EMDR used for DID is slightly 
        different to other conditions. So it is important that your doctor 
        knows about your DID before you start EMDR.
        <h3>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</h3>
        Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is another type of talking 
        therapy. You will talk about the way your thoughts and feelings 
        could cause emotional problems. And how your behaviours may make 
        this worse. You focus less on the past and try to change the way 
        you think and behave. Parts of CBT are recommended to treat DID, 
        by helping you to change your thoughts and behaviours that come 
        from the trauma. A CBT approach has also been suggested for 
        long-lasting DPDR. If you have DPDR you might often worry about 
        your symptoms and think you have a serious mental illness or 
        that something is wrong with your brain. CBT may help to change 
        this way of thinking. By reducing your anxiety and depression 
        that comes with this worrying, it may also reduce your symptoms 
        of DPDR.
