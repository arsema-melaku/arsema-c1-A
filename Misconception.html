        The misconception regarding dissociative identity disorder and 
        schizophrenia is largely caused by focusing on a few key parts 
        of symptoms rather than the disorder as a whole. Dissociative 
        identity disorder refers to a condition in which multiple fully 
        formed personality alters co-exist and shift within one person.
        Dissociative identity disorder movies, such as 2017’s “Split,” 
        may get some aspects of the disorder correct, but tend to get 
        the majority wrong. Dissociative identity disorder symptoms are 
        exaggerated in the media and in many cases, the symptoms shown 
        are entirely fictional. Many people assume that the symptoms 
        shown on TV and in the movies have at least have some basis in 
        reality. Even if a person takes media’s portrayal with a grain 
        of salt and assumes symptoms are exaggerated, they may still 
        believe many falsehoods about the condition to be true. Switching 
        between states usually does not occur as frequently or dramatically 
        as is portrayed by media; in most cases, states subtly and covertly 
        shift. An additional problem with the media portrayal of 
        dissociative identity disorder is the stigma it creates. 
        The negative stereotypes of the disorder perpetuated by TV and 
        movies may discourage people living with the condition from getting help.

        Researchers have found that on average a person will receive up 
        to four incorrect diagnoses before being accurately diagnosed 
        with dissociative identity disorder. A person may spend twelve or
         more years in the mental health system before this correct 
         diagnosis is given. There are multiple contributing factors to 
         this problem of misdiagnosis. First, most patients with this 
         disorder do not present seeking help for this disorder. Instead, 
         a person is more likely to seek treatment for symptoms of the 
         disorder that disrupt their daily functioning, such as mood 
         dysregulation or constant fatigue. In some cases, a person may 
         seek treatment for childhood trauma and be unaware of their 
         dissociative identities. Misdiagnosis can also be due to the 
         difficulty of distinguishing the signs of dissociative identity 
         disorder, especially in outpatient settings. The most obvious 
         symptom — multiple identities — may not be identified unless a 
         personality shift occurs during a therapy session. Even within 
         the medical community, there are misconceptions about 
         dissociative identity disorder. This misinformation likely 
         inhibits the diagnostic process as all professionals may not 
         be familiar with the disorder and its specific symptoms. 
         Further, despite evidence asserting its validity, some providers 
         may still not believe that a dissociative identity disorder 
         diagnosis is valid
