        The Dissociative disorders are a family of disorders that are 
        united by the fact that they all involve the process of 
        dissociation. Dissociation is a mental process involving 
        changes in normal memory and attention that lead to changes 
        in the availability and accessibility of memory. Under normal 
        conditions people are able to recall most everything they 
        experience. By contrast, dissociative people may be unable 
        to recall memories for events that they experienced while dissociated.

        Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), 
        is a mental disorder characterized by the maintenance of at least two distinct and relatively enduring
        personality states.The person literally dissociates himself/herself 
        from a situation or experience too traumatic to integrate with his 
        conscious self. Symptoms of these disorders, or even one or more of 
        the disorders themselves, are also seen in a number of other mental 
        illnesses, including post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, 
        and obsessive compulsive disorder.

        what types of dissociative disorders there are. It also
        discusses what might cause them and options for
