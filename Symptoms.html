            Dissociative identity disorder is characterised by the presence of 
            two or more distinct personality identities. 
            Each may have a unique name, personal history and characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Symptoms of DID in adults include:
            a sense of “losing time”, confusion, 
            exhibition of two or more personalities (alters), 
            feelings of detachment (dissociation), memory gaps, 
            out of character behavior. Out-of-character behavior is 
            the result of alternate identities being in control.
            Children who have experienced emotional neglect, sexual abuse, and violence are at an increased risk of developing DID.
        </p>
        <p>
            Symptoms in children include: 
            having distressing dreams and memories, 
            being unresponsive or “zoning out” (dissociating), 
            mental distress to trauma reminders (triggering), 
            physical reactions to trauma or memories, such as seizures, 
            showing unexpected changes in food and activity preferences.
            DID is believed to develop in childhood, and symptoms may become more severe over time.

            <h2>Causes and risk factors</h2>
            Dissociation or detachment is a common coping mechanism for 
            extreme stress and trauma, especially in childhood. DID is one 
            of several dissociative disorders.People of any age, ethnicity, 
            gender, and social background can develop DID, but the most 
            significant risk factor is physical, emotional, or sexual abuse 
            during childhood. Dissociation, or detaching from reality, can 
            be a way of shielding the main personality from a painful mental 
            or physical experience. In this way, a different personality 
            experiences the trauma instead, leaving the person with little 
            or no memory of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
           <h2> Living with DID</h2>
            People living with DID often refer to themselves as having alters 
            or multiples. DID can have a significant impact on mental health, 
            relationships, and a person’s ability to work. Living with DID 
            can be frustrating, scary, and isolating. Many people do not get 
            diagnosed until they are adults, meaning they might experience 
            years of frightening symptoms without knowing why. A person’s 
            alternate personalities may not always cooperate with each other. 
            When another personality takes control, a person may “wake up” in 
            an unfamiliar place with no memory of how they got there. 
            However, the personalities may also work well together and help 
            a person cope with everyday situations. Other people may not 
            notice the shifts between personalities, as some people with 
            DID may not display noticeable outward changes. Some people 
            with DID may also suffer from social stigmas. Many people are 
            only familiar with DID from what they have read in fiction or 
            seen in movies. People with DID do not inherently have a 
            violent alternate personality — in fact, this is rare.

            individual with DID developed the condition and managed it:
